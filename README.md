3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.

      Activity Bar: Located on the left side of the window, it provides access to various features such as the Explorer, Search, and Source Control.
      Side Bar: Appears when you click on an icon in the Activity Bar. It displays the contents of the selected feature (e.g., the file system in the Explorer).
      Editor Group: The central part of the window where you edit your code.
      Status Bar: Located at the bottom of the window, it displays information about the current file and provides access to various settings and features.

4. Command Palette:

      The Command Palette is a powerful tool in VS Code that allows you to access various commands and features quickly. You can access it by pressing "Ctrl + Shift + P" (Windows/Linux) or "Cmd + Shift + P" (Mac). Examples of common tasks performed using the Command Palette include searching for files, changing settings, and running tasks.

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

      Extensions in VS Code provide additional functionality, such as new languages, themes, and debugging tools. To find, install, and manage extensions, follow these steps:

      Click on the "Extensions" icon in the Activity Bar or press "Ctrl + Shift + X" (Windows/Linux) or "Cmd + Shift + X" (Mac).
      Search for the desired extension in the marketplace.

      Set breakpoints in your code by clicking to the left of the line numbers.
      Start the debugging session by clicking on the "Start Debugging" button.
      Key debugging features in VS Code include stepping through code, inspecting variables, and using the call stack.

10. Using Source Control:
